# CosmicHUD
A simple and smooth Heads Up Display plugin. The same one used in CosmicPE.
Features:
- Less load on server than other HUDs (because this HUD sends popup every 1 second, not every 1/20 seconds).
- When an enchanted item is held, the HUD will be deactivated so the player can get the item's enchants.
